This repository contains the weekly lab exercises for the Robot Vision Module.

Each week it will be updated with the content for that week. `git clone` for the first week and then `git pull` for the following weeks.

If you are missing dependencies such as skimage in your vLab instance, you can install the dependencies by adding the following command to the top of your notebook file.

`%pip install scikit-image`

Make sure you restart your kernel for the changes to take effect
